Programming Problem - Find Longest Word Made of Other Words
======================

 
Write a program that reads a file containing a sorted list of words (one word per line, no spaces, all lower case), 
then identifies the longestword in the file that can be constructed by concatenating copies of
shorter words also found in the file.

For example, if the file contained:

       cat
       cats
       catsdogcats
       catxdogcatsrat
       dog
       dogcatsdog
       hippopotamuses
       rat
       ratcatdogcat

The answer would be 'ratcatdogcat' - at 12 letters, it is the longest
word made up of other words in the list.  The program should then
go on to report how many of the words in the list can be constructed
of other words in the list.

Solution:
======================

Approach:
I have decided to implement a Trie data structure to store that words that have already been seen thus far.
This is essential as we need to know which words have been seen thus far so that we can use them to check if
the given word is made of the words seen thus far.
Trie is highly scalable as well as search time depends on depth of the trie. It als utilizes the fact that each
word may be a prefix of other to save space required to save these words.

The solution is made of two classes Node and Trie. Node is an individual node on the Trie while Trie is the
collection of nodes. It also has a main function that iterates through the file and for each word, checks for
longest word and second longest word, adds them on to the trie. Then at the end closes the file and diplays the
longest and second longest words respectively.

Result:
On running the program on the words given in the text file, the program outputs following.
Longest Word: electroencephalographically
Second Longest Word: immunoelectrophoretically
