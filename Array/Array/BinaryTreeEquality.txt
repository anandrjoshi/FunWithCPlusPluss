Psuedocaode to check if two binary trees are same.


//my solution. Assuming that the binary tree has integers.	
Check_Equal(Node * tree1, Node * tree2)
	int inorder_tree1[] = Inorder(tree1)
	
	int inorder_tree2[] = Inorder(tree2)
	
	//ensures length and order is correct.
	if(inorder_tree1 != inorder_tree2)
		return false
	
	int breadth_first1[] = Breadth_first_traversal(tree1)
	
	int breadth_first2[] = Breadth_first_traversal(tree2)
	
	//ensures that the structure is correct. This might make the above 
	//length and order check redundant.
 
	if(breadth_first1 == breadth_first2)
		return true
	else
	return false
