Given some array such as {4, 2, 5, 3}, write a function that would take in the array 
and a number that would return how many pairs add up to the number and also print them.

Solution:
O(n^2) solution is what is provided.

O(nlogn) solution: sort the array which takes O(nlogn) best. then scan the array with two pointers
to find target-arr[i] = arr[j]. this is O(n).

O(n) solution: use hash map.
hash the array into a hash table. then for each entry in array finf Hash(target-arr[i]) exists. this
is O(n) only to scan through all the elements of the array.
